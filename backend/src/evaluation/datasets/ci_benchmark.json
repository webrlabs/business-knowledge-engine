      "answer": "The purchase order approval process involves three main steps: requisition submission by the requesting department, review and approval by the budget owner, and final approval by procurement. Orders above $10,000 require additional CFO approval.",
      "context": "The standard purchase order workflow begins with a requisition form submitted through the procurement portal. The budget owner reviews the request against available funds. Once budget approval is obtained, procurement validates the vendor and pricing before final processing. High-value purchases over $10,000 threshold require executive sign-off from the CFO.",
      "expectedAnswer": "Purchase orders go through requisition, budget owner review, and procurement approval. High-value orders need CFO approval.",

      "question": "Who handles invoice disputes?",

      "context": "When an invoice discrepancy is identified, the AP Specialist raises a dispute ticket in the financial system. The dispute is routed to Procurement for vendor communication. Resolution involves matching purchase orders, receipts, and contracts. Final approval comes from the Finance Manager for write-offs above threshold.",
